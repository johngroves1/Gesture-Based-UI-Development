The character is controlled using the accelerometer	and gyroscope of the mobile device. By tilting the phone in a leftwards direction, the character moves left and by tilting the phone in a rightwards direction, the character moves right. If the character collects the jetpack, holding down a finger on the screen will activate the jetpack. You can pause the game at any time by swiping down anywhere on the screen.
