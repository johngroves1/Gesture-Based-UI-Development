The character is controlled using the accelerometer	and gyroscope of the mobile device. By tilting the phone in a leftwards direction, the character moves left and by tilting the phone in a rightwards direction, the character moves right. If the character collects the jetpack, holding down a finger on the screen will activate the jetpack. You can pause the game at any time by swiping down anywhere on the screen.

# Gestures identified
The gestures used in this application are a variety of finger and hand movements. The gestures control all forms of navigation, UI and game mechanics. The user experience was kept in mind while deciding on and incorporating these gestures into the application.
